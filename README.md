Study and Experiments on Linear Regression Models | Machine Learning

Instructor: Prof. Amit Sethi, Electrical Engineering, IIT Bombay | Python (Jan’22 - Feb’22)

(a) Coded and tested gradient descent to train and validate L1 and L2 penalized linear regression from scratch

**Explanation**

(a) L1 and L2 penalized linear regression implementation can be found in the **Part 1** of **"213070003_213070014_1.ipynb"** file. Gradient descent is implemented in
**part 1** and tested on data in **part 2**
